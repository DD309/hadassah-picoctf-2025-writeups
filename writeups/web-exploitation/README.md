## Hints

1. Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

---

## Initial look

When you open the link, youâ€™re greeted with a basic login form asking for a username and password.

I tried logging in with random credentials (like `admin / admin123`) â€” and surprisingly, it logged me in, but no flag appeared.

# How to solve it

At first, I thought there might be some hidden page or response based on the username or password. But after trying various combinations â€” nothing interesting happened.

Then I remembered the hint:  
> *"It doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's..."*

That made me think maybe the check happens **after** login â€” maybe via cookies?

So I opened the **Developer Tools** (`F12` in Chrome), went to the **Application** tab, and looked under **Cookies** for the site.

There I found a cookie called:
```
admin=False
```

Hmm. That looks suspicious.

So I changed it to:
```
admin=True
```

Then I refreshed the page.

Boom ðŸ’¥ â€” the flag was displayed!

## The flag
